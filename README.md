##About Petful

Petful is a web application for adopting pets online. Users may either choose to adopt a cat or dog; no other pets are hosted on the platform. All adoptions are done on a first-in, first-out basis, meaning that the pets kept on the platform for the longest period of time must be adopted first. Users have a choice of either adopting a cat or dog, but have no choice in which dog or cat they wish to adopt.
